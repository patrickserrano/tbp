        <h1>Take Back Productions</h1>
        <p class="date">2006-2008</p>
        <p>
          Take Back Productions was a small record label based on the north fork of Long Island, born out of two friends
          and their love of music.
        </p>
        <p>
          We put out a few records, and had a lot of fun doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're no longer active, but we're keeping this site up as a reminder of the good times we had. Thanks to
          everyone that came to a show or bought a record.
